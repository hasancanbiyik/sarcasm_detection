# sarcasm_detection
The goal of this project is to develop a sarcasm detection model that will classify sentences as 'sarcastic (1)' vs 'non-sarcastic/literal (0)' with as high accuracy as possible. This research is coordinated by Hasan Can Biyik and Ruhan Coban (PhD candidate at University of Memphis) under the supervision of Professor Roger Kreuz.
