"HOWARD: This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest. They have a great house ale. | PENNY: Cool tiger. | HOWARD: Yeah, I've had him since level ten. | HOWARD: His name is Buttons. | HOWARD: Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest. | PENNY: That sounds interesting. | HOWARD: You'll think about it?",PENNY: I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.,1
"SHELDON: Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place. | LEONARD: So Penny's a little messy. | SHELDON: A little messy? | SHELDON: The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy. This is chaos. | SHELDON: Excuse me. | SHELDON: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.",SHELDON: I'm just inferring this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table is having a tiny garage sale.,1
"SHELDON: Oh, good Lord. | LEONARD: God, that's a good song.","SHELDON: If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.",1
LEONARD: How do I look? | SHELDON: Could you be more specific? | LEONARD: Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?,SHELDON: No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.,1
"SHELDON: You know, I am not going to enjoy this party. | LEONARD: I know, I'm familiar with you. | SHELDON: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes. | LEONARD: Yes, I was there. | SHELDON: You know what's interesting about caves? | LEONARD: What? | SHELDON: Nothing. | LEONARD: Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.","SHELDON: How's this? ""Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser. ""How fortunate for you that the university's ""chosen to hire you, despite the fact ""that you've done no original research in 25 years, ""and instead have written a series of popular books ""that reduce the great concepts of science ""to a series of anecdotes, ""each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration ""of an average bowel movement.",1
"PERSON: He switched over to high-energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. | PERSON: You're in? | LEONARD: Yeah, sure, why not? | PERSON: Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place. | LEONARD: Why at my place? | PERSON: Department of Energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. | PERSON: Nice meeting you. | PENNY: Yeah, you, too.
Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello.","LEONARD: Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in Advanced Placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.",1
"SHELDON: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing Halo. | LEONARD: Fine. We'll just play one-on-one until he gets back. | SHELDON: One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. | SHELDON: We play teams, not one-on-one. | SHELDON: One-on-one. | LEONARD: The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.","RAJ: Sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from.",1
"SHELDON: This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. | SHELDON: Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.","SHELDON: Well, I'm sorry, too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet.",1
"HOWARD: I promised my mother. | RAJ: I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. | RAJ: But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer. | SHELDON: Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays. | LEONARD: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?","SHELDON: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but Occam's rasor would suggest that someone threw it out.",1
PENNY: Hey Sheldon. | SHELDON: Hello Penny. | PENNY: Get anything good?,SHELDON: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly.,1
PENNY: Hey Sheldon. | SHELDON: Hello Penny. | PENNY: Get anything good? | SHELDON: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly.,"PENNY: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't.",1
"LEONARD: Take that! | LEONARD: What's the matter? | HOWARD: This granola bar has peanuts in it! | LEONARD: Oh, my God. Why did you eat it? | HOWARD: I don't know. It was just there! | LEONARD: If I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? | HOWARD: Don't yell at me! I've got to go to the emergency room!","HOWARD: - Now?! - No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket!",1
"HOWARD: It's smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it? | RAJ: What else? Sell it on eBay as ""slightly used."" | LEONARD: It was Penny's boyfriend's, they broke up. | HOWARD: Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere. | LEONARD: I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.","HOWARD: Good idea, sit with her. Hold her, comfort her. And if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.",1
"HOWARD: Are you saying that you've been holding back? | LEONARD: Of course. Out of respect. | HOWARD: So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny? | RAJ: Who were you respecting then? | LEONARD: Well, I've dated plenty of women. | LEONARD: There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle","SHELDON: Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary. The word ""plenty"" has been redefined to mean ""two.""",1
"SHELDON: Pastries such as bear claws? | PENNY: Yeah, sure. | SHELDON: I don't like bear claws. | PERSON: Hey, Penny. | PERSON: Dumbass. | SHELDON: Leslie Winkle. | SHELDON: Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle? | PENNY: They have a lot in common. I mean, they're both scientists.","SHELDON: Oh, please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resumed sending chimps into space.",1
"RAJ: They're going to digitally add a supernova.
They say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent. | SHELDON: Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas that collapses upon itself. | RAJ: Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor. | RAJ: Go for Koothrappali.","HOWARD: They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen, I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.",1
"PERSON: Excuse me, Dr. Cooper. I'm Kathy O'Brien. | PERSON: I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.","SHELDON: Maybe when I publish it, I'll include an inhaler.",1
"LEONARD: Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off? | RAJ: Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.","HOWARD: Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.",1
"SHELDON: Will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best? | RAJ: I have three words for you: Wrath of Khan. | HOWARD: Thank God, you're here. | LEONARD: What's the emergency? | HOWARD: I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch. | SHELDON: Where?",HOWARD: On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!,1
"HOWARD: So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home. | PERSON: Okay. Let's go, friend Leonard. | HOWARD: I'll call ya. | PERSON: So are you a scientist like Howard? | LEONARD: No one's a scientist like Howard. | HOWARD: My mother is so gonna love her.",SHELDON: How nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.,1
"LEONARD: What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?! What, Sheldon?! | SHELDON: Tell me what you see here.",LEONARD: The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?,1
PERSON: Oh no | SHELDON: What?,PERSON: You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I've never seen anything like it.,1
"HOWARD: There are always do-overs when my people play sports. | SHELDON: Where were you that's more important than Wii bowling night? | LEONARD: Actually... | SHELDON: It's rhetorical.
There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night. | LEONARD: Come on, it's just a video game. And we suck at it. | SHELDON: Nice motivational speech from the team captain. | SHELDON: Where were you?","HOWARD: ""Dave."" Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.",1
"HOWARD: You're kidding. You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps. That's the estrogen hat trick. | SHELDON: What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. | SHELDON: It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan.","RAJ: If you don't like this stuff, let's go next door and build her a bear.",1
"PERSON: Leonard. Come, join us. | LEONARD: Hey, Dave.
And Penny, what a surprise. | PENNY: Dave was just showing me around the university. This place is unbelievable! | LEONARD: I know, I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.","LEONARD: - Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like ""yoga.""",1
LEONARD: Where are we going? | SHELDON: You're driving me to the mall. | SHELDON: I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friend-making.,LEONARD: Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?,1
"SHELDON: Ask me why. | LEONARD: Do I have to? | SHELDON: Of course. That's how you move a conversation forward. | LEONARD: Why? | SHELDON: The learning opportunities would be abundant. | SHELDON: Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.",PENNY: I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.,1
"LEONARD: Hey. | PENNY: Hey. | LEONARD: A little mood lighting, huh?","PENNY: When I didn't pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.",1
"HOWARD: but wait to be captured or killed. | PERSON: That's the worst part, the waiting. | HOWARD: All the while knowing that there's a paint pellet out there with your name on it. | PERSON: The big wet ball of death.","PERSON: Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?",1
"SHELDON: See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. | SHELDON: I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera. | LEONARD: That does sound much simpler. | LEONARD: How long is this going to take?","SHELDON: Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes. Plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.",1
"SHELDON: They're here. | LEONARD: Stay calm. We don't know anything about them yet. | LEONARD: What are you doing? | SHELDON: I'm checking for musical instruments. | SHELDON: Does that sound like castanets to you? | LEONARD: The box says ""kitchen.""","SHELDON: So? Do cocaine smugglers write ""cocaine"" on the box?",1
"PENNY: Come on. I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening. | PERSON: Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese. | PENNY: You know, it's kind of early.
Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee? | PERSON: Gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?","PENNY: You think ""coffee,"" means coffee. That is so sweet.",1
"RAJ: It's actually a very elegant system. You know, what goes around comes around. | HOWARD: Speaking of what goes around comes around... | RAJ: Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely? | SHELDON: It won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient. | RAJ: What if we reposition the collection tank? | SHELDON: It won't work. No way to mount it.","HOWARD: Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?",1
"LEONARD: You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night? | SHELDON: He didn't respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was. | LEONARD: You could have waited until morning. | LEONARD: I know, look who I'm talking to. | SHELDON: Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?",LEONARD: Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.,1
"SHELDON: Of course not. I'm a theoretical physicist.
A career I chose in no small part because it's indoors, but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientis to confirm string theory. | SHELDON: People will write books about me. | SHELDON: Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.","LEONARD: Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.",1
"HOWARD: Don't push me, Sheldon.
I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it. | SHELDON: Oh, really? | SHELDON: Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister. | SHELDON: And I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation-- be it noogies, swirlies or the classic ""Why are you hitting yourself?""","RAJ: Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.",1
"PENNY: Alright, want some French toast? | SHELDON: It's oatmeal day. | PENNY: Tell you what, next French toast day, I'll make you oatmeal. | SHELDON: Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French toast day? | LEONARD: Morning. | SHELDON: Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast. | LEONARD: Sorry, I haven't given her your schedule yet.",SHELDON: It's an iCal download. She can put it right in her phone.,1
"LEONARD: Howard, what did you do? | HOWARD: They're called tattoo sleeves. Look. | HOWARD: I got them online. Raj got a set, too. | HOWARD: Fantastic, right? | HOWARD: Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.","SHELDON: You know, I've always wanted to go to a Goth nightclub.",1
"PENNY: My God, she didn't! | LEONARD: What could she possibly be talking about for so long?","SHELDON: Obviously, waitressing at The Cheese Cake Factory is a complex socio-economic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning.",1
LEONARD: When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?,SHELDON: When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the Battlestar known as Galactica.,1
"LEONARD: Let me ask you something. | LEONARD: Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch? | HOWARD: No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line. | LEONARD: Thank you!","HOWARD: But if she dumps you, she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you'll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one.",1
"HOWARD: So nice you could join me this evening. | HOWARD: You're looking lovely as always. | PERSON: Thanks, Howard.  Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies. | HOWARD: Come on, Katee. Don't make it sound so cheap.","PERSON: I'm sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.",1
"HOWARD: Thank you. | HOWARD: So, shall we get started? | PERSON: Sure.
But can I ask you a question first? | HOWARD: Do you want to play Cylon and colonist? | PERSON: I want to know why you're playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight. | HOWARD: You mean, Bernadette?","PERSON: No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She's a wonderful girl and she really likes you.",1
"HOWARD: I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner. | LEONARD: Sure. The more, the merrier. | SHELDON: Wa- no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. | SHELDON: If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating. | LEONARD: Sheldon... | SHELDON: Don't ""Sheldon"" me. We ordered for five people, not six. | PENNY: Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.","SHELDON: Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?",1
"LEONARD: I am.
Are you interested in physics? | BERNADETTE: Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn't gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics.
Or ice dancing. | LEONARD: Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential. | BERNADETTE: That's amazing. | SHELDON: Yes.",SHELDON: Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.,1
"BERNADETTE: So, what should we talk about? | HOWARD: Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?","PENNY: Oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.",1
"HOWARD: There's a 39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's. | HOWARD: Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front. | SHELDON: Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?","HOWARD: I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.",1
SHELDON: Hello. | PENNY: Hello | SHELDON: Alright dispense with the friendlt banter | SHELDON: I believe you know why I'm here.,"PENNY: Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.",1
"SHELDON: Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus? | HOWARD: My guess is, ""Hey, four minutes! New record!"" | HOWARD: That's why I'm the funny one. | LEONARD: Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff. | HOWARD: They were closing up. We got this whole box for 60 bucks. | LEONARD: We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.",PENNY: There a new girlfriend in there? 'Cause you might need one.,1
"LEONARD: Hey, Sheldon. I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science. | SHELDON: And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? | SHELDON: I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. | SHELDON: All right, I'll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honoring this year?","LEONARD: Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that. You.",1
"LEONARD: I honestly don't care. | RAJ: Really? Because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals, you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions. | LEONARD: What do you want from me? I just don't give a rat's ass. | HOWARD: Would that be a giant rat's ass? | SHELDON: For the record, giant rats are possible.",LEONARD: Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?,1
"HOWARD: Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock. | SHELDON: Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one. | PENNY: Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack. | PERSON: Hey. | SHELDON: Hello. | PERSON: Whoa! Is that the laser? It's bitchin'. | SHELDON: Yes.","SHELDON: In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper <i>""Zur Quantentheorie der</i> <i>Strahlung,""</i> his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'.",1
SHELDON: And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury? | SHELDON: What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die.,LEONARD: A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?,1
"PERSON: That's what I love about science-- there's no one right answer. | LEONARD: So...you and Zack again, huh? | PENNY: Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again. | PERSON: Were we here earlier? | PENNY: Okay, we should, we should go. | PERSON: Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.","HOWARD: Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about-- rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?",1
"PERSON: Wow, this place is awesome. | PERSON: Where do they keep the Archies?","SHELDON: In the bedrooms of ten-year- old girls, where they belong.",1
"RAJ: Stupid Aquaman. | LEONARD: If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time. | PERSON: Whoa. You dated Penny? | LEONARD: She didn't tell you? | PERSON: She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. | PERSON: Who would have thought it was you? | LEONARD: Who else would it be?","PERSON: I don't know. Somebody bigger and... Yeah, sure. Why not you?",1
"BERNADETTE: Are you guys doing okay? | HOWARD: Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon. | BERNADETTE: Well, that shouldn't be too hard. He's such a cutie. | RAJ: Thank you, but ""cute"" is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like... like a labradoodle.
Labradoodle?",LEONARD: We might be starting to zero in on your problem.,1
"SHELDON: Why not? It seems like you're improvising your entire curriculum. | PENNY: This is all about listening and responding. | SHELDON: Gotcha. | PENNY: I'm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it. | SHELDON: All right. | PENNY: All right. | SHELDON: Action. | PENNY: Okay, it's not a movie. It's improv. So no one calls ""action.""","SHELDON: Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?",1
"LEONARD: Yes, I live with him.
I don't... I-I really don't know why. | LEONARD: Tonight? Sure, that'd be great. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. | LEONARD: She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.","SHELDON: An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?",1
"PERSON: Thank you, Leonard. That doesn't make it sound boring at all. | AMY: So, how you holding up? | PENNY: I'm fine. | AMY: Oh, who are you kidding? She's breathtaking. | PERSON: So, Penny, Leonard tells me you're an actress. That must be pretty exciting.","PENNY: Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.",1
"SHELDON: The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right? | LEONARD: Right. | SHELDON: Is it about me or the dead pixels? | RAJ: Hey, you're just in time. We made Tex-Mex. | LEONARD: Oh, sounds great. | SHELDON: Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. | SHELDON: Might as well have had the Chinese pizza. | PERSON: Hey, you.","HOWARD: That's got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister's mouth?",1
"SHELDON: but the driver didn't look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it. | AMY: Wise. | PENNY: There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean. | AMY: Hi, bestie. | PENNY: Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been? | AMY: Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.","PENNY: Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?",1
"BERNADETTE: Um, no. | AMY: You should get one. | BERNADETTE: What's that? | AMY: It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic. | PENNY: Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year. | BERNADETTE: Oh, God, that is so romantic. | PENNY: Yeah, it was. | BERNADETTE: Leonard's really one of a kind.","AMY: Saying that while holding a snowflake is a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?",1
"AMY: That bitch is crafty. | BERNADETTE: You think? | AMY: Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member. | BERNADETTE: Well, what makes me the weakest member? | AMY: Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.","PENNY: Okay, Amy, you're being silly. I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.",1
"SHELDON: The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. | SHELDON: Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend. | RAJ: Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about. | RAJ: Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other. | BERNADETTE: You guys ready to order?","SHELDON: Yes, I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac-- to induce vomiting-- and a mint.",1

"HOWARD: I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy. | PERSON: Howard, you've got to tell your mother. | HOWARD: Hey, have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of skim milk here? | PERSON: Uh... that's different.
First of all, we're not engaged; and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.","HOWARD: Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.",1

"PENNY: You mean when he was little. | PERSON: Not as little as you'd want him to be. | PENNY: You know, this stuff is horrible.

AMY: the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. | AMY: Is there something wrong with your neck? | SHELDON: It's a little stiff. | SHELDON: What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. | SHELDON: Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick. | AMY: Have you considered massage?,"SHELDON: I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.",1
"SHELDON: And a living will and durable power of attorney. | RAJ: This says you can make ""end of life"" decisions for me. | SHELDON: As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that. 
Please sign. | RAJ: Did you sign this? | LEONARD: There's a reciprocity clause.
You get to pull the plug on him, too. | RAJ: Well, that seems fair.","SHELDON: Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here's your I.D. card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear.",1

"PENNY: Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally wear corsages to a wedding. 
That's more of a prom thing. | AMY: I never went to my prom. 
My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs. | PENNY: Put the corsage on her. | LEONARD: When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.","AMY: When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.",1

"AMY: What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party? | PENNY: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy. | AMY: Mortal enemy? | AMY: Mm-hmm. Sheldon, I know you're a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but...
you really have a mortal enemy? | SHELDON: In fact, I have 61 of them. | SHELDON: Would you like to see the list? | PENNY: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.",SHELDON: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This'll just take a moment. It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.,1
"HOWARD: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me. | RAJ: Wow. You're not only our first astronaut.
You're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. | RAJ: You're like a rock star. | HOWARD: Little bit. | LEONARD: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.","SHELDON: You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.",1
"PERSON: All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet. 
And my personal favorite, Gunning with God. | LEONARD: What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask. | PERSON: Oh, it is a hoot and a half. | PERSON: You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire 'em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord's forgiveness.","SHELDON: Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become-- willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.",1
SHELDON: That lecture was a waste of time. | SHELDON: I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. | AMY: Are you getting sick?,"SHELDON: No, I'm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.",1
"SHELDON: Okay, all right. | SHELDON: That one was clever. | SHELDON: Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. | SHELDON: Come on out, merry pranksters. | SHELDON: Take a bow. | RAJ: You should've seen your face.","SHELDON: Yes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.",1
"PENNY: Yeah, sure, come on in. | LEONARD: Thanks. | PENNY: Want some mac and cheese? | LEONARD: No. Lactose. Gas. | PENNY: Glass of wine? | LEONARD: No. Sulfites. Migraines. | PENNY: Okay, well, I'd offer you Halloween candy, but that's gone. | PENNY: So, what's up? | LEONARD: Okay, we used to go out, right?","PENNY: Oh, my God, that's where I know you from.",1
"PENNY: So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?","BERNADETTE: Well, if you don't mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.",1
"LEONARD: Okay. So... we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people,","LEONARD: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.",1
"SHELDON: consider changing disciplines.
Yeah, to the humanities-- perhaps history. | SHELDON: One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things. | SHELDON: You know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. | SHELDON: You could have fun with that. | LEONARD: Yeah, that's not it. | LEONARD: Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.","SHELDON: Oh, of course he is. She's very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?",1
"LEONARD: No, that was a different, different guy. | SHELDON: Was he the one who used your head to open a nut? | SHELDON: Oh, oh, oh. | SHELDON: Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair? | LEONARD: No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister. | PENNY: All right, well, what do you think he wants? | LEONARD: I don't know.","SHELDON: You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.",1
"SHELDON: Oh, oh, oh. | SHELDON: Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair? | LEONARD: No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister. | PENNY: All right, well, what do you think he wants? | LEONARD: I don't know. | SHELDON: You know, the holidays are just around the corner. | SHELDON: Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there. | LEONARD: I told you. That was a different guy.",PENNY: Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.,1
LEONARD: It's 2:00 a.m. What are you doing up? | SHELDON: Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.,LEONARD: Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.,1
"SHELDON: Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks. | LEONARD: You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard. | PERSON: Not really, no. | PERSON: It's funny, huh, Leonard? | PERSON: Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser.
And now we're reversed. | PERSON: You're the winner.",SHELDON: You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.,1
"SHELDON: It's probably a euphemism for urination. | PENNY: Sheldon, what is wrong with you? | SHELDON: Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. | SHELDON: I don't know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside. | PENNY: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.","SHELDON: Oh, I see why you're confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you're forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That's all about yucky, squishy things.",1
"PENNY: This is amazing.
How did you even get this idea? | LEONARD: I called your dad.
I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. | LEONARD: This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it. | PENNY: Okay, you're kind of really great.",LEONARD: You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?,1
"RAJ: Buzz Lightyear is not real. | HOWARD: No, that's not what I'm talking about. | RAJ: Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real? | HOWARD: No | RAJ: Okay, um... how about ""Crash""? 
Howard ""Crash"" Wolowitz.","HOWARD: Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named ""Crash.""",1
"SHELDON: All right. | SHELDON: I'm no stranger to a little gray matter. | SHELDON: Locus coeruleus. | SHELDON: Locus coeruleus. | AMY: You're getting warmer-- it is, indeed, in the brain.","AMY: Hope your hands are steady. It's the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you.",1
"SHELDON: Wrong. Leonard? | LEONARD: Horse, but mostly just for the height. | LEONARD: A little bit for the genital girth. | SHELDON: Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we? | HOWARD: Kangaroo, uh, I'd be Kanga-Jew. | HOWARD: The first of my people to dunk a basketball.","LEONARD: Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body.",1
"HOWARD: after you had a snootful of this, laddie! | BERNADETTE: Funny. | BERNADETTE: You boys have a nice time? | HOWARD: Yeah, it was great. | HOWARD: Low-key, like I promised. 
No hanky-panky, no strippers.
Just the guys telling jokes. | BERNADETTE: That's nice.","HOWARD: How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.",1
"SHELDON: ""Release the Kraken."" That never gets old. | SHELDON: ""Release the Kraken!"" Oh, chills. | SHELDON: Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy. | RAJ: Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone. | RAJ: W-Which is cool.
I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so...
Cool.","SHELDON: Darn. If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us.",1
"SHELDON: My tongue won't go as far forward as it used to. | LEONARD: Maybe your tongue is shrinking. | SHELDON: Nope. | SHELDON: Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.",LEONARD: I'm starting to get a sense of it.,1
"AMY: You slept with him? | PENNY: I didn't know what else to do.
He had those big, sad eyes. | BERNADETTE: Oh, sure, you had no choice. | PENNY: He looked at me like this.","AMY: Well, if that's all it takes, it's a good thing you don't have a dog.",1
"SHELDON: the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right. | SHELDON: And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize. | PENNY: Yeah, that's basically what I said. | SHELDON: The point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, | SHELDON: perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.",LEONARD: I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.,1
"SHELDON: It was a compromise. I lost. | RAJ: Can you believe Stuart's walking around taking credit for this party? | HOWARD: Who cares? | RAJ: What do you mean ""who cares""? Look at what I pulled off here.
The deejay's on fire, there's a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food! | RAJ: Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.","HOWARD: You're right, the party's fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven't heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old!",1
"SHELDON: (thermometer beeps) 102.2.
(coughs)",SHELDON: Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It's like you're not even trying to get better.,1
"SHELDON: Hello. | SHELDON: Uh, four glasses of water, please. | SHELDON: Anything for you guys? | LEONARD: Can I use your phone? 
Our car got stolen.",PERSON: Why don't you ask Scotty to beam you up?,1
"HOWARD: to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation. | RAJ: Way to make lemonade.
You know, from around the corner where fudge is made. | HOWARD: Hey, I got a favor to ask. | RAJ: Sure. | HOWARD: My mom's been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.","RAJ: Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift?",1
"LEONARD: I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met. | PENNY: Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple.",PENNY: Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.,1
RAJ: It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day can come here tonight and be together.,"PERSON: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.",1
"SHELDON: It ended on a cliffhanger. | LEONARD: They did. | PENNY: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them? | SHELDON: Dumplings?
Don't you understand what's going on here? | PENNY: As a rule, no. | SHELDON: That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious.
Now I'll never know what happened. | PENNY: Well, why don't you make up your own ending?","SHELDON: Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums. I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.",1
"RAJ: Probably because I didn't read the instructions.
No wrapper's going to tell me what to do. | RAJ: Unless his name is Jay-Z. | PERSON: Is something going on? | RAJ: What do you mean? | PERSON: Well, you're acting all weird.
And I'm pretty weird, so I think I know what I'm talking about. | RAJ: I don't know. Maybe it's all those steroids I've been taking.",PERSON: I think I'm gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.,1
LEONARD: Do you think Penny's mad at me?,BERNADETTE: Because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it? I'm sure she finds it charming.,1
"SHELDON: So what'd you think? | AMY: It was good. | SHELDON: That's it? | SHELDON: ""Good""?","AMY: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be ""losing my virginity,"" I didn't think you meant showing me <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> for the first time.",1
"AMY: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be ""losing my virginity,"" I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark  for the first time. | SHELDON: My apologies. I chose my words poorly.
I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. | SHELDON: Anyway, thank you for watching it.
It's one of my all-time favorites.",AMY: It was very entertaining... despite the glaring story problem.,1
"PENNY: Awkward silence. Sheldon on his phone.
No touching. Somebody's having date night. | AMY: It's actually steamier than it looks.
Sheldon's looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings. | SHELDON: Oh, no, I got bored with that.
I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.",PENNY: How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?,1
"LEONARD: Yup, oh... here you go. | SHELDON: Oh, thank you. | SHELDON: Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles. | LEONARD: Oh-ho.
I forgot about this. 
My aunt made it for me when I started college. | PENNY: Aw, did she hate you?","LEONARD: Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.",1
"HOWARD: We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed. 
We should bring something. | SHELDON: I already am.
I'm bringing the gift of knowledge. | HOWARD: Oh, boy. | SHELDON: Despite what her Bible says, recent archeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.",HOWARD: I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.,1
"BERNADETTE: So, what happens next? | RAJ: I can't tell you that.
But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.","PENNY: Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.",1
"RAJ: You're all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. | RAJ: (electronic sound effects playing) And welcome to 20 years in the future. | RAJ: Hey, you guys just time-traveled.
Stop looking so bored.","PENNY: Well, my beer isn't flat and my rack's not saggy. So far, the future's great.",1
"SHELDON: it's-it's what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don't want to do. | SHELDON: He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn't want to, which was look at my stupid face. | LEONARD: That's a rude thing to say. Out loud. | SHELDON: It's an outrage.
Honestly, I'm tempted to leave the university.","HOWARD: You know, if you're really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.",1
"SHELDON: Ugh! It's like walking into the Amazon.
And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping.
The awful one with birds and snakes. | AMY: You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain. | SHELDON: Four keys!
Who does he think he is, a warden? | AMY: See? Maybe you'll love living alone. | SHELDON: I don't know. Perhaps.","AMY: And if it turns out you don't... - you and I could live together. - You and... Oh, sure.",1

And while we're at it, why don't we get engaged, too? Why don't we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?!",1
"SHELDON: Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you. | LEONARD: There isn't any ranking. | LEONARD: And if there were, we wouldn't be at the bottom of it. | PENNY: Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc. | LEONARD: That's the part you have a problem with? | PENNY: Relax.","AMY: There they go, fighting again. You'd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.",1
"RAJ: You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dump Leonard? | PENNY: Why say it? Yes! | RAJ: Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we're playing fast and loose with the word list. | PENNY: Well, good job. Now she hates me. | RAJ: Great.","SHELDON: On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next.",1
"LEONARD: Robot girlfriend. | HOWARD: Mm, that was mine. | LEONARD: Robot prostitute. | HOWARD: Also mine. | SHELDON: Wait. I'm confused. 
Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute? | HOWARD: There's just some things you don't do with your robot girlfriend.
Boy, when you met Bernadette,","RAJ: Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.",1
"PENNY: Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you. | LEONARD: Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so... | LEONARD: ...really, it's what I think love looks like. | BERNADETTE: I'll be right back. I'm gonna go check on him.",PENNY: Maybe it's a good thing we came here. It's like a lesson in what not to do.,1
"BERNADETTE: So, what are you working on these days? | AMY: I'm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame. | BERNADETTE: What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?","PENNY: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.",1
"HOWARD: A gallant man would defend his fiance for being called a urethra. | LEONARD: Can we please change the subject? | RAJ: Well, that didn't go your way. | PENNY: Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here? | PERSON: Uh, well, actually I came to see you. | PENNY: Really? Why?","LEONARD: Ah, that's a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.",1
"PENNY: I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper. | BERNADETTE: Right here. | PENNY: You guys are the best. | AMY: What's with the clothes? | PENNY: Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet. | AMY: I meant why are they folded? 
But whatever. | AMY: Ooh, what's this? | PENNY: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.","BERNADETTE: Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.",1
"LEONARD: Okay, why?",SHELDON: I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.,1
"BERNADETTE: You heard what he said about his parents. 
It was the little things they kept bottled up. 
I don't want that to happen to us. | HOWARD: How can I convince you it won't? | BERNADETTE: Well, is there anything about me you're keeping inside? | HOWARD: I'm not answering that. 
It's a trap. | BERNADETTE: So there<i> are</i> things you don't like.",HOWARD: And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I'm gonna chew my leg off.,1
"HOWARD: And I love that you're strong and independent. | BERNADETTE: And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me. | HOWARD: I love that I'm kind of a slob around here, and...
you're okay with that. | BERNADETTE: Uh-huh.","BERNADETTE: And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you're okay with that.",1
"SHELDON: I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard. | LEONARD: You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me.
You love me. | SHELDON: Yeah. Tell me those aren't the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. | SHELDON: Amy, you're a neuroscientist.
Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.","BERNADETTE: I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you're in there spending an hour on your hair.",1

"PENNY: Hey, how are things going with your parents? | RAJ: Not great. They hired divorce attorneys. | SHELDON: You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.","PENNY: You know what? That was almost on topic. I'm gonna say, ""Good job, Sheldon.""",1
"LEONARD: Okay. On the count of three, I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. | LEONARD: Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. | LEONARD: Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.",HOWARD: Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?,1
"LEONARD: This isn't so bad. | SHELDON: That's easy for you to say. 
Your chair's not facing the lingerie section. | SHELDON: Boy, that's a lot of panties. | AMY: You guys comfy? This might take a while. | SHELDON: You know, I don't understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.","PENNY: No, you're right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.",1
"BERNADETTE: Can you please just let it go? | SHELDON: Oh, I can help you with that. | SHELDON: Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen. | SHELDON: While your favorite pen is safe and secure in your pocket. | HOWARD: Hold that thought. | HOWARD: Hello? | AMY: How can I make this up to you?",PENNY: The answer's in this puzzle box. Let's see if you can open it.,1
"HOWARD: Hold that thought. | HOWARD: Hello? | AMY: How can I make this up to you? | PENNY: The answer's in this puzzle box. 
Let's see if you can open it. | BERNADETTE: You could have at least warned him about the furniture. | RAJ: That's what I said when we moved it. | BERNADETTE: You helped him?!","RAJ: No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.",1
AMY: we decided that the time was right to take a step forward. | LEONARD: Okay. | SHELDON: Do you want to say it? | AMY: Let's say it together. | SHELDON: We're getting a turtle!,PENNY: This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.,1

"SHELDON: I don't believe it matters what the topic is. | SHELDON: What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. 
It's all about the execution. | LEONARD: Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. | LEONARD: Uh, new salon topic.
What's more important, an idea or its execution? | BERNADETTE: Oh, that's fun.","SHELDON: Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned.",1
PENNY: I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life.,HOWARD: It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.,1
"BERNADETTE: So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.

Weren't you going to show me your laboratory at 1:00?",LEONARD: There's no hurry. Tell them more about their secret love for each other.,0

"LEONARD: You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work. | SHELDON: Okay, I know what you're doing. | LEONARD: Really? | SHELDON: Yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
Very Good.","LEONARD: - Chocolate? - No, I don't want any chocolate!",0

"AMY: ""And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye, ""and Nicholas is scalded in the towte.
This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte."" | PENNY: What the hell was that?","AMY: Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. ""The Miller's Tale"" by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.",0

We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.",0
"HOWARD: Why not ""World's Greatest Engineer""? | SHELDON: I'm sorry.
I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter.

Your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?,0

How can she have dinner? | LEONARD: Fine, whatever. 
Priya will be having breakfast.","SHELDON: All right, so technically it's not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, ""Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?""",0

It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet. | AMY: Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right.",SHELDON: Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged.
